# SeatUp!

This is just a simple project that "Younglings" created for video prototype of Designing Interactive Systems 1, 2014 Winter Semester Project. 

Important note: Project is just a storyboard without any code, but for some reason storyboard decided not to work properly. Though it works fine when compiled.
